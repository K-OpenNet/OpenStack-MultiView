# SmartX Multi-View: Multi-layer Visibility

### What is SmartX Multi-View?
SmartX Multi-View is an Open-source implementation of SmartX Multi-View Visibility Framework (MVF) by leveraging various existing open-source monotiroing and data processing tools for Multisite SDN-Cloud Playgrounds. It can support Multiple layers of visibilities (i.e., resource, slie, flow and workload).

### Requirments
* Ubuntu Operating System 16.04.03 LTS (Xenial)

### Release Version ###
This is the second version of SmartX Multi-View software.

### Notice
This version of SmartX Multi-View Visibility software supports Overlay-based Underlay Resource-layer, Physical Resource-layer, Virtual Resource-layer and Flow-layer visibilities.

### Top-Level Features
* Visibility collection Using Intel Snap Telemetry Framework, sFlow, eBPF-based network packets collection, SDN network controllers, and custom Java-based collectors.
* Visibility transfer using Kafka and Zookeeper open-source Frameworks.
* Visibility storage and staging using MongoDB, Elasticsearch and InfluxDB DataStores.
* Visibility Visualization using NodeJS, Express framework, Vis.js, D3.js, Bootstrap and others.
